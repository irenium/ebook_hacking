# Using Data to Answer "What Makes a Good Story?" #

##Background##
How often do you hear someone asking "Have you read any good books lately?" Usually, the person asking this question has probably wasted hours of their life reading crappy books. When you login to amazon.com, you're given suggestions for what books you would like, based on the books you've already read. Unfortunately, their algorithm for finding interesting books seems to be limited to *I see you've read the Hunger Games ... here are some more Dystopian novels for you. Maybe you should try the Twilight series - it's also popular, young adult fiction.* Meh - not helpful. In reality, I like all sorts of books. I've read over 100 classic novels, and am a fan of Dostoyevsky, but I also enjoy reading Harry Potter and similar young adult fantasy. And just because I've enjoyed a couple books from a particular genre, doesn't mean I only want to read books from that genre! I would guess that a good story is independent of genre, and strikes a certain balance between character depth and character breadth. The catch here is that some people don't care about character breadth (think about The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka, where the entire story is a window into the mind of a single character), and some people prefer books with enormous breadth (honestly, I couldn't keep track of the characters in One Hundred Years of Solitude).

##Hypothesis##
Quantifying character breadth versus character depth can help you identify the types of books that you enjoy reading. In this way, data can help us answer the question of "what makes a good story?" (which is of course, dependent on the user's personal reading preferences but not necessarily dependent on genre).

### Assumptions ###

* When creating the character lists, I deleted last names to avoid double counting. The assumption here is that characters are usually referred to by one name more than the other.  This also helps to avoid confusion over shared family names.

### Future Work ###

* Add more books, including fiction outside the scope of "young adult."
